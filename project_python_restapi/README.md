# About

Create a simple REST service which will return details of given Github repository. Details should
include:
- full name of repository
- description of repository
- git clone url
- number of stargazers
- date of creation (ISO 8601 format)

The API of the service might look as follows:
```
GET /repositories/{owner}/{repository-name}
{
"fullName": "...",
"description": "...",
"cloneUrl": "...",
"stars": 0,
"createdAt": "..."
}
```
GitHub API reference can be found at: https://developer.github.com/v3/
#### Non functional requirements:
- should be able to serve 20 requests per second (assuming we have premium GitHub
account; simply put: application should not have obvious scaling bottlenecks)
- set of end-to-end tests that can be run easily
- good design and quality of code including documentation
- ready to deploy to production (if additional work is needed, please specify it)

# Project
### Requirements to run this project:
- linux (tested on ubuntu) and 8080 unused port
- installed chrome
- installed [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#set-up-the-repository)
- installed curl
- installed ab ( Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool: ``` sudo apt-get install apache2-utils ```)

### Problems:
- sometimes docker stucks with this error:
  >Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint - 
  ``` docker stop $(docker ps -a -q); docker rm $(docker ps -a -q); docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true) ```

### Structure:
- **app**:
    - api.token: it is a file with my secret token to query github api without restrictions
    - GitHubApi.py: it is a class wrapper for github api
    - MainApp.py: it is an implementation of flask server that starts rest api
    - Wsgi.py: it is a code for starting flask server from uWsgi server
- **conf**:
    - nginx.conf: it is a configuration file for nginx
    - requirements.txt: it is a configuration file for installing python packages when docker starts
    - supervisord.conf: it is a configuration file for app that starts all servers when linux is starting up in docker
    - wsgi.ini: it is a configuration file for uWsgi server
- **test**:
    - funkload: it is a directory of implemenation tests in funkload
    - locusTest.py: it is a simple test for locus package
    - unitTest.py: it is a unit test for testing querying github api and the response with required data  
- **Dockerfile**: file for running in docker
- **RunApp.sh**: it runs app in docker
- **RunAppTest.sh**: it runs app tests  
- **Run.sh: it runs app in docker and app test, so it is a main start for the project**
  
# Test results
There are two types of tests in this project:
1. Unit test to check working functionality (it is in test/unitTest.py)
2. Stress test to check 20 multiple requests at one time. I used ab (Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool)

### Result of stress tests:
First example is to stress test only when api is running. So I decided to run test with 1000 requests and 20 multiple requests at a time:
```
ab -n 1000 -c 20 http://localhost:8080/

Server Software:        nginx/1.14.0

Total:          1    4   2.9      3      25

Percentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms)
  50%      3
  66%      4
  75%      4
  80%      4

  95%      7
  98%     20
  99%     22
 100%     25 (longest request)
```
Second example is to check when api is working with specified query that invokes github api. This is a fully working example of 50 requests and 20 multiple users at a time 
``` 
ab -n 50 -c 20 http://127.0.0.1:8080/repositories/lumyslinski/app_projects

  95%   4223

```

# My steps to solve this project:
1.Get knowledge about github api:
 - Created user token in order to serve 5000 requests per hour from github api. It is a safer method than providing username and password with api url
 - Example of querying github api and response: 
 
 ```
curl -H "Authorization: token 2e016c12ad016e068eac7116d982406f43c6fc7e" https://api.github.com/repos/lumyslinski/app_projects

- Get interesting data and map them:
    - fullName 	  -> full_name
    - description -> description
    - cloneUrl    -> clone_url
    - stars       -> stargazers_count
    - createdAt   -> created_at (date format of created_at is already in ISO8601 format)

2.Write unit tests for quering github repo of mine and check results.

3.Then use this test to implement rest api:
- create GitHub class based on tests to load secret token and get result from calling  
- add rest api framework like Flask
    
4.Make it scalable and ready for production:
![Communication flow](communication_flow.png?raw=true "Communication flow")
- Flask has got only a developer server to debug app. On production it should be connected with uwsgi and nginx to scale and run with full performance. That's why I chose unix socket to bound uWsgi and nginx because it is a fastest method. 
- Added support of Docker to isolate this project and run out of the box whole application. I used as a base alpine linux which is the smallest Linux distribution.

5.Run some performance tests (20 requests per second):
- tried funkload, but there was a problem with running commands
- tried PycURL, but there was a problem with installing it
- tried ab (Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool)

# Final thoughts
This system could be enhanced with redis to cache requests and responses. Cache time should be reasonable due to refreshing star number.
