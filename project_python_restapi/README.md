# About

Create a simple REST service which will return details of given Github repository. Details should
include:
- full name of repository
- description of repository
- git clone url
- number of stargazers
- date of creation (ISO 8601 format)

The API of the service look as follows:
```
GET /repositories/{owner}/{repository-name}/{optional-secret-token-from-github}
{
"fullName": "...",
"description": "...",
"cloneUrl": "...",
"stars": 0,
"createdAt": "..."
}
```
GitHub API reference can be found at: https://developer.github.com/v3/
#### Non functional requirements:
- should be able to serve 20 requests per second (assuming we have premium GitHub
account; simply put: application should not have obvious scaling bottlenecks)
- set of end-to-end tests that can be run easily
- good design and quality of code including documentation
- ready to deploy to production (if additional work is needed, please specify it)

# Project
### Requirements to run this project:
- linux (tested on ubuntu) and 8080 unused port
- installed chrome
- installed [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#set-up-the-repository)
- installed curl
- installed ab ( Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool: ``` sudo apt-get install apache2-utils ```)

### Problems:
- sometimes docker stucks with this error:
  >Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint - 
  ``` docker stop $(docker ps -a -q); docker rm $(docker ps -a -q); docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true) ```

### Structure:
- **app**:
    - GitHubApi.py: it is a class wrapper for github api
    - MainApp.py: it is an implementation of flask server that starts rest api
    - Wsgi.py: it is a code for starting flask server from uWsgi server
- **conf**:
    - nginx.conf: it is a configuration file for nginx
    - requirements.txt: it is a configuration file for installing python packages when docker starts
    - supervisord.conf: it is a configuration file for app that starts all servers when linux is starting up in docker
    - wsgi.ini: it is a configuration file for uWsgi server
- **test**:
    - funkload: it is a directory of implemenation tests in funkload
    - locusTest.py: it is a simple test for locus package
    - unitTestGitHubApi.py: it is a unit test for testing querying github api and the response with required data  
    - unitTestLocalRestApi.py: it is a unit test for testing rest api locally
- **Dockerfile**: file for running in docker
- **RunApp.sh**: it runs app in docker
- **RunAppTest.sh**: it runs app tests  
- **Run.sh: it runs app in docker and app test, so it is a main start for the project**
  
# Test results
There are two types of tests in this project:
1. Unit test to check working functionality (it is in test/unitTest.py)
2. Stress test to check 20 multiple requests at one time. I used ab (Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool)

### Result of stress tests:
First example is to stress test only when api is running. So I decided to run test with 1000 requests and 20 multiple requests at a time:
```
ab -n 1000 -c 20 http://localhost:8080/

Benchmarking localhost (be patient)

Completed 400 requests
Completed 500 requests
Completed 600 requests
Completed 700 requests
Completed 800 requests
Completed 900 requests
Completed 1000 requests
Finished 1000 requests

Second example is to check when api is working with specified query that invokes github api. This is a fully working example of 50 requests and 20 multiple users at a time 
```

# My steps to solve this project:
1.Get knowledge about github api:
 - Created user token in order to serve 5000 requests per hour from github api. It is a safer method than providing username and password with api url
 - Example of querying github api and response: 
 
 ```
curl -H "Authorization: token {secret-token}" https://api.github.com/repos/lumyslinski/app_projects

- Get interesting data and map them:
    - fullName 	  -> full_name
    - description -> description
    - cloneUrl    -> clone_url
    - stars       -> stargazers_count
    - createdAt   -> created_at (date format of created_at is already in ISO8601 format)

2.Write unit tests for quering github repo of mine and check results.

3.Then use this test to implement rest api:
- create GitHub class based on tests to load secret token and get result from calling  
- add rest api framework like Flask
    
4.Make it scalable and ready for production:
![Communication flow](communication_flow.png?raw=true "Communication flow")
- Flask has got only a developer server to debug app. On production it should be connected with uwsgi and nginx to scale and run with full performance. That's why I chose unix socket to bound uWsgi and nginx because it is a fastest method. 
- Added support of Docker to isolate this project and run out of the box whole application. I used as a base alpine linux which is the smallest Linux distribution.

5.Run some performance tests (20 requests per second):
- tried funkload, but there was a problem with running commands
- tried PycURL, but there was a problem with installing it
- tried ab (Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool)

# Final thoughts
This system could be enhanced with redis to cache requests and responses. Cache time should be reasonable due to refreshing star number.
